This repo contains my coursework for 'Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development' found at https://fullstackopen.com

This course covers basics of React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
